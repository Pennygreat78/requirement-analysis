# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

This repository is dedicated to learning and documenting **requirement analysis** in software development. It includes examples, templates, and best practices for gathering, analyzing, and validating software requirements.  

### Purpose  
- To understand key concepts like functional & non-functional requirements.  
- To explore techniques like use cases, user stories, and acceptance criteria.  
- To provide resources for effective requirement documentation.  
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that bridges the gap between business needs and technical solutions.

### Key Aspects:
1. **Definition**: Identifying and specifying user needs and constraints
2. **Documentation**: Creating clear, unambiguous requirement specifications
3. **Validation**: Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible

### Importance in SDLC:
- Helps prevent project failures by clarifying expectations early
- Reduces development costs by identifying issues before coding begins
- Ensures the final product meets stakeholder needs
- Provides a foundation for system design and testing
- Helps manage scope and prevent "scope creep"

### Process Includes:
- Gathering requirements from stakeholders
- Analyzing and prioritizing requirements
- Documenting requirements (SRS, user stories, use cases)
- Validating requirements with stakeholders
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is fundamental to successful software development for several key reasons:

1. **Prevents Costly Errors**  
   - Identifying and fixing requirements issues early is 100x cheaper than fixing them in production
   - Reduces rework and development waste by clarifying needs before coding begins

2. **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment**  
   - Bridges communication gaps between business teams and developers
   - Creates a shared understanding of what the system should (and shouldn't
