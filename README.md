# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

This repository is dedicated to learning and documenting **requirement analysis** in software development. It includes examples, templates, and best practices for gathering, analyzing, and validating software requirements.  

### Purpose  
- To understand key concepts like functional & non-functional requirements.  
- To explore techniques like use cases, user stories, and acceptance criteria.  
- To provide resources for effective requirement documentation.  
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that bridges the gap between business needs and technical solutions.

### Key Aspects:
1. **Definition**: Identifying and specifying user needs and constraints
2. **Documentation**: Creating clear, unambiguous requirement specifications
3. **Validation**: Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible

### Importance in SDLC:
- Helps prevent project failures by clarifying expectations early
- Reduces development costs by identifying issues before coding begins
- Ensures the final product meets stakeholder needs
- Provides a foundation for system design and testing
- Helps manage scope and prevent "scope creep"

### Process Includes:
- Gathering requirements from stakeholders
- Analyzing and prioritizing requirements
- Documenting requirements (SRS, user stories, use cases)
- Validating requirements with stakeholders
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is fundamental to successful software development for several key reasons:

1. **Prevents Costly Errors**  
   - Identifying and fixing requirements issues early is 100x cheaper than fixing them in production
   - Reduces rework and development waste by clarifying needs before coding begins

2. **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment**  
   - Bridges communication gaps between business teams and developers
   - Creates a shared understanding of what the system should (and shouldn't
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis process consists of five fundamental activities:

1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - Identifying all potential sources of requirements (stakeholders, documents, systems)
   - Conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops with stakeholders
   - Researching existing systems and industry standards

2. **Requirement Elicitation**
   - Extracting hidden or unstated needs through techniques like:
     - Brainstorming sessions
     - User observation
     - Prototyping
     - Use case analysis
   - Resolving conflicts between different stakeholder requirements

3. **Requirement Documentation**
   - Creating clear, unambiguous requirement specifications
   - Common documentation formats include:
     - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
     - User stories
     - Use cases
     - Process flow diagrams
   - Maintaining traceability between requirements

4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
   - Analyzing requirements for completeness, consistency, and feasibility
   - Creating models to represent requirements visually:
     - Data flow diagrams
     - Entity-relationship diagrams
     - State transition diagrams
   - Prioritizing requirements based on business value and technical constraints

5. **Requirement Validation**
   - Reviewing requirements with stakeholders for accuracy
   - Conducting feasibility studies and risk analysis
   - Creating test cases to verify requirements
   - Obtaining formal approval/sign-off on requirements
## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system should do - the specific behaviors and functions it must perform.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
1. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - The system shall allow users to create accounts with email and password
   - The system shall enable users to log in using their credentials

2. **Property Search & Booking**
   - The system shall allow users to search properties by location, date, and price range
   - The system shall enable registered users to book available properties

3. **Payment Processing**
   - The system shall process credit card payments for bookings
   - The system shall generate payment receipts

### Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform - the quality attributes and constraints.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
1. **Performance**
   - The system shall load search results within 2 seconds for 95% of queries
   - The booking process shall complete within 5 seconds

2. **Security**
   - The system shall encrypt all sensitive user data (payment info) using AES-256
   - The system shall prevent brute force attacks by locking accounts after 5 failed login attempts

3. **Availability**
   - The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours (8AM-10PM local time)
   - The system shall recover from failures within 15 minutes
## Use Case Diagrams

### What is a Use Case Diagram?

A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of how users (actors) interact with a system. It outlines the systemâ€™s functionalities (use cases) and the users involved, helping identify system requirements clearly and early in the development process.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Provides a high-level view of system functionality
- Helps identify primary users and their goals
- Improves communication between stakeholders and developers
- Simplifies the requirement gathering process

### Use Case Diagram for Booking System

The diagram below illustrates a basic use case scenario for a booking system:
